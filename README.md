Stuartâ€™s Udacity Capstone Project

This project is the final piece of work in the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

The App and API is a Casting Agency which allows users to view/add/modify/delete Actors amd Movies as well as assigning Actors to Movies.
The application has a front end based on the Fyyer project.
The application is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed via https://stuart-capstone.herokuapp.com

All backend code follows PEP8 style guide.

Getting Started

Developers using this project should already have Python and PIP installed on their local machines.

To set up the configuration variables and to run 'requirements.txt', from the root folder run:
source setup.sh

To run the application run the following command:
flask run

The application is run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default.

Tests
In order to run tests run the following commands from the root folder:
dropdb capstone_test
